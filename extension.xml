	Release History:
		1.0 - Initial release
		1.1 - Display indicator for players, lock scaling to cntrl-wheel
		1.2 - Players can change height themselves (with option)
		1.3 - Non-square tokens scale correctly
		1.4 - Players can set height to 0.  Heights shown automatically instead of only when DM first alters them.
		1.5 - Protect against empty combat tokens
		1.6 - Use height in the range arrow
		1.7 - Protected against a token without getOwner()
		1.8 - Removed need for grid, update range display without losing/gaining focus
		1.9 - Removed conflict with 5E - Aura Effects
		1.10 - Override getDistanceBetween to allow other extensions to get distance with height
		1.11 - Fix the error in variant diagonals
		2.0  - Support for more rulesets, fixed another error in variant diagonals
		2.1  - Support for 4E and the "raw" flag on individual maps
		3.0  - Add options for height indicator placement and fonts
		3.1  - Allow for arbitrary token sizes, squares give correct measurements.
		3.2  - New updates for token sizes and map options by bmos, mattekure, and SoxMax
		3.3  - Fixed getDistanceBetween
		3.4  - Try to keep going when some functions disappear...
		3.5  - Remove errors from non-combat tracker tokens
		3.6  - Fixed error with a slope of 0
		3.7  - Reverted override of image.lua in extensions to fix image functions from disappearing. Fixed conflict with Critically Awesome Essentials.
		3.8  - Fixed issue with reverting to original image functions when maximizing window / sending to back
		3.9  - Fixed issue with dropping tokens with thanks to bratch9
		3.10 - Work around a case where Interface disappears
		4.0  - Added new diagonal measurement for variant
		4.1  - Changed all local functions to just functions in an attempt to remove the disappearing functions bug
		4.2  - Applied bmos's fix for calling getDistanceBetween with coordinates instead of tokens leading to error spamming
		4.3  - Added diagonal option for short/long diagonals when variant diagonals are used (previously just for PFRPG2).  Added Starfinder as supported ruleset.  Added support for tokenids in getDistanceBetween.
		4.4  - Added a guard for CombatManager disappearing per suggestion from bmos, just in case
		4.5  - Overrode imagecontrol getTokensWithinDistance to allow other extensions which call that to take height into account.  Overrode Token versions of getDistanceBetween and getTokensWithinDistance to call the imagecontrol versions.  Return 0 instead of nil in getDistanceBetween if CombatManager disappeared.
		4.6  - Added font color options
		4.7  - Fixed typo found by bmos in Token.getDistanceBetween 
		4.8  - Return the correct token type in getTokensWithinDistance

		4.11 - And fixed bug with 4.10
		4.12 - Incorporated SilentRuin's performance updates and calls to super() in image.lua
		4.13 - Additional performance improvements with help from SilentRuin
		4.14 - Fixed a disconnect between host and client by making things a bit less efficient
		4.15 - Incorporated Arnagus fix for targets on multiple maps
		4.16 - Fixed bug where first time clients couldn't update height by themselves
		4.17 - Work with multiple maps open at the same time with different units
		4.18 - Allow tokens to be slightly skewed (helps on hex maps). Still calculate when heights are the same for consistency with diagonal logic and rounding.
		4.19 - Made half-squares consistent with base FGU
		4.20 - Restored ability for players to adjust heights that hadn't been adjusted first by GM
		4.21 - Fixed incompatibility with Aura Effects
		4.22 - Print warning if token.size is undefined instead of error
		5.0  - Provide ability to get tokens within a given shape.  Show heights upon map loading.  Set heights to 0 when moving to new map.
		5.1  - Updated to fix issues with large creatures and for future compability with Size Matters (ActorCommonManager.getSpaceReach)
		5.2  - Reverted back to getting space from the DB instead of ActorCommonManager.getSpaceReach (doesn't work as expected when adjusting space)
		5.3  - Fixed an incompatibility with the Assistant GM extension
		5.4  - Only call THI code for add/delete on the server and optimized the token refresh, with help from SilentRuin
		5.5  - Recreated base FGU logic for distances, which should make everything consistent (internally and with FGU functions)
